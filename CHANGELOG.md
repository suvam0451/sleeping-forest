## [0.6.7] - 17 Feb 2020

- Removed complicated settings. Edits made to the **.code-workspace** file is now fully customizable by you using `SF.excludeFolders`, `SF.searchExclude`, `SF.excludedExtensions`.
- This means, unless you are working on Editor extensions, you get best results using the default settings itself.
- Patched a bug where Context won't activate with components with default values in header

### Feature Updates:

- Added `UE4 : Add Override function`. Helps adding { OnConstruction, Tick, BeginPlay etc.}
- Also **supports context key**. Activates from lines with { public: , private: , protected: } in header.
- Can be extended with `Functions_Ext.json` in sidebar. See `Functions_Core.json`(ReadOnly) for default list.
- Added `SF.excludeFolders`, `SF.searchExclude`, `SF.excludedExtensions` for more control.
- Removed `SF.allowUserExtensions`. Modding support is always on from now.
