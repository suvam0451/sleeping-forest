**Sleeping Forest** is a VSCode extension for _Unreal Engine 4_ that provides powerful **code-completion** and **command-line features** for programmers and **asset management**, **optimization tools** for designers.

The primary goal is to help in creating data-driven gameplay, optimized level design, shader authoring and faster development iteration through DevOps tools and smart code-completion. **Note that multiplayer is not supported as of yet.**

Note that this the plug-in is **currently in beta** and undergoing improvements. If you want to tag along and suggest features, join [my discord](https://discord.gg/8Qd8a66) to help build the best gamedev extension for vscode !!!

As of now, only Windows support is available for micro-services.

## Installation

To install through VS Code extensions, Search for `Sleeping Forest - UE4 Multitool` in extension market.

Or you can grab one of the CI build output packages from here --> [![](https://gitlab.com/winterwildfire/ue4/trailblazer/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/suvam0451/sleeping-forest-ue4/pipelines/)

## Key Features

- Improved Intellisense
- Exhaustive snippet library *(200+ from select modules)*
- Context-aware convenient code-completion features
- File/function/header generator/manager
- Command line shader/game/code compilation support
- Modding support for most modules
- Various micro-service integrations
- Support for writing UE4 HLSL shaders [Planned]

### Asset Streams Overview

UE4 allows convenient importing of assets via python scripts. We have a bundled app *(a group of golang scripts)* which dynamically generate the import data for the raw assets we have in a folder.

This makes adding/managing raw .fbx/.png assets easier.

**Most of the documentations are now being configured to be auto-generated. So, any changes in the extension will be immediately reflected in the website.**

## Coding Features Overview

### Better intellisense

Configurable setting to override configuration in the .code-workspace file for better search results and faster overall performance. _(Your experience may vary)_

### Contextual auto-completion

150+ snippets and counting.
Constantly updated support towards smart auto-completion at generic/repetitive blocks of code as shown below.

### Class/Header/Function generation

Commands to add templated class files, headers from inside (.h/.cpp) files and automatically adding common functions liek BeginPlay in (.h/.cpp).
These features can be customizing by your own JSON definitions. [See more...](https://suvam0451.netlify.com/docs/sleeping-forest/extension-files)

Also, support for

- **Class generation** for Actors, ActorComponents. [More...]()
- Contextual constructors for Component properties

### Command line tools

Detects engine and project folders and runs generated commands from cmd using tools provided by Epic.
No concrete benchmarks yet but from tests, 50k shaders could be compiled within an hour.

The code compilation features are also solid when you do not want to wait for the engine to load while fixing bugs.

# Micro services(currently only for windows)

The following service tools are currently available for **windows only**. Convenient way to optimize, update and manage assets through concept of asset streams.

### Batch export tool

Assembles information about raw assets in tagged **asset-stream folders** and produces a python file which can be used in UE4 to automatically
import all assets into respective folder structure and settings using python API.

![Batch export]

### Texture Packing tool

Able to pack different types of textures into RGBA channels of a single mega texture. This is the feature being currently worked on. Fully supports asset stream workflow.
Supported import extensions are { jpg, tiff, png }, supported output extensions are png and jpg with quality settings

### Asset Audit tool

Every folder is inside an asset stream is scanned and indexed in JSON files. These can be imported into UE4 directly for data driven gameplay elements.

## Building from source

**The VSCode package** can be obtained by

```npm
yarn install
yarn run webpack
yarn vsce package
```

**The golang executables** can be built by

```go
go build texture_packer.go
```

Don't forget to set GOOS/GOARCH environment variables.
You just need executables for your own platform. Copy then to respective /bin folder for the extension before packaging.

# Disclaimer

I work on this extension in my free time. Community collaboration is very important to me. Please consider joining my discord and suggesting improvements.
It is recommended you use it on casual projects. The project is undergoing rapid progress and we don't want remnant bugs to break anything.
**Stability will be guaranteed post 1.0.0 launch.**

You are free to tag along. I would love to hear what you improvements you have in mind.
